    1539. Kth Missing Positive Number

    Given an array arr of positive integers sorted in a strictly increasing order, and an integer k.

    Find the kth positive integer that is missing from this array.

    Example 1:

    Input: arr = [2,3,4,7,11], k = 5
    Output: 9
    Explanation: The missing positive integers are [1,5,6,8,9,10,12,13,...]. The 5th missing positive integer is 9.
    Example 2:

    Input: arr = [1,2,3,4], k = 2
    Output: 6
    Explanation: The missing positive integers are [5,6,7,...]. The 2nd missing positive integer is 6.

arr = [2, 3, 4, 7, 11];

k = 5;

function kThMissingPositiveNum(arr, k) {

    let counter = 0;

    for(let i = 1; i <= 1000; i++) {

         if(i != arr[counter]) {

            
         }
